Description
Redirecting to a URL that is constructed from parts of the DOM that may be controlled by an attacker can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.
